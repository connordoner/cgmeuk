      <p>Because of what <a href="https://www.gurste.com">my startup</a> does, I
         regularly receive email from people seeking help in an emergency. As
         much as I would love to help everybody, I am but one man, and am unable
         to do so without sacrificing my already-fragile mental health. Please
         therefore contact your local emergency services in the first
         instance.</p>

      <p>If your contact does not relate to an emergency, please send email to
         one of the following email addresses, depending on why you’re
         contacting me:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>BlackBerry®-related projects: <a href="mailto:blackberry@connorgurney.me.uk">blackberry@connorgurney.me.uk</a></li>
        <li>Media enquiries: <a href="mailto:press@connorgurney.me.uk">press@connorgurney.me.uk</a></li>
        <li>This website: <a href="mailto:webmaster@connorgurney.me.uk">webmaster@connorgurney.me.uk</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>If none of those options fit, please send email to
        <a href="mailto:me@connorgurney.me.uk">me@connorgurney.me.uk</a>.</p>

        <h2>Standing invitation</h2>

        <p>Ripped off from my dear friend,
           <a href="https://aaroncarson.co.uk/contact/standing-invitation/">Aaron Carson</a>,
           who himself ripped it off from <a href="https://matthewpalmer.net/standing-invitation/">Matthew Palmer</a>,
           I’m open to you sending or asking me anything that you think that I
           might either find interesting or be able to help with.</p>

        <p>For the avoidance of doubt (and, yes, this is sadly a common enough
           occurrence that it needs mentioning), I am not interested in your
           sexual fantasies, your anatomy or the intersection between the two.
           Please see your partner, your doctor, or, in the worst-case scenario,
           both.</p>

        <h2>Etiquette</h2>

        <p>I receive approximately 250 emails and text messages each and every
           day (and, sadly, yes, that does include Sunday!). I’d therefore be
           grateful if you would include a descriptive subject line so that I
           can prioritise your email accordingly.</p>

        <p>I would also be grateful if you would please avoid trying to sell me
           anything. I am a young and healthy man which means that I thankfully
           have absolutely no use for the many strange concotions in my Spam
           folder that offer to make it easier for me to satisfy those to whom
           I’m attracted.</p>
