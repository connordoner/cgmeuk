# ADR 1: Migrate away from Google Sites

## Context

My personal website has been hosted on [Google Sites][gsites] for around 18 months at the time of writing. Before that, it used a custom CMS that I'd built using Ruby on Rails and which was hosted on Heroku.

This isn't because Google Sites is the best tool but because it was the quickest to migrate to when my custom CMS was no longer fit for purpose and cost nothing above and beyond my existing Google Workspace subscription.

My personal circumstances have changed so I now have more free time and am going to use some of this time to further develop what I've already got. The first step towards this is to move to something that's less restrictive than Google Sites.

## Decision

I'm going to migrate the content hosted on my personal website away from Google Sites. For now, I'm going to hand-write HTML, but I'll likely use or develop a static site generator further down the line (that's the modern version of "Hello world!", right?).

Because my website uses a default design from Google Sites, I'll also have to re-design the user interface. However, I haven't considered what this will look like yet, so I'm going to leave that mostly up to the browser for now. 

## Consequences

My personal website will be back in my control and will provide me with more flexibility to showcase who I am, what I care about and what I'm doing than it does right now.

That control will also allow me to fine-tune my website to meet metrics that matter to me, such as performance and SEO. This won't be hard compared to Google Sites which feels as though it's second only to [Microsoft Word][wordmarkup] for so-called nasty HTML.

I'll also be able to treat my personal website as something of a playground to learn new technologies and try them in a semi-production environment. I can also work on developing my soft skills such as planning my ongoing development, writing technical documentation and kicking ADHD up the arse.

All that said, I'll have to work harder than previously to keep my personal website available to the world and up-to-date with modern web standards. I'll manage this risk by using my resilience experience from [my startup][startup] and making my website highly available (unless an unnamed country begins a special military operation against my host!).

Finally, I will have have to spend more on hosting compared to when I used Google Sitesâ€”especially given my intentions around resilience. However, I'm in a better financial position now than I have been previously, and am therefore willing and able to spend more.
