# Contact me

Because of what [my startup](https://www.gurste.com) does, I regularly receive email from people seeking help in an emergency. As much as I would love to help everybody, I am but one man, and am unable to do so without sacrificing my already-fragile mental health. Please therefore contact your local emergency services in the first instance.

If your contact does not relate to an emergency, please send email to one of the following email addresses, depending on why you’re contacting me:
      
* BlackBerry®-related projects: [blackberry@connorgurney.me.uk](mailto:blackberry@connorgurney.me.uk)
* Media enquiries: [press@connorgurney.me.uk](mailto:press@connorgurney.me.uk)
* This website: [webmaster@connorgurney.me.uk](mailto:webmaster@connorgurney.me.uk)

If none of those options fit, please send email to [me@connorgurney.me.uk](mailto:me@connorgurney.me.uk).

## Standing invitation {#invitation}

Ripped off from my dear friend, [Aaron Carson](https://aaroncarson.co.uk/contact/standing-invitation/), who himself ripped it off from [Matthew Palmer](https://matthewpalmer.net/standing-invitation/), I’m open to you sending or asking me anything that you think that I might either find interesting or be able to help with.</p>

For the avoidance of doubt (and, yes, this is sadly a common enough occurrence that it needs mentioning), I am not interested in your sexual fantasies, your anatomy or the intersection between the two. Please see your partner, your doctor, or, in the worst-case scenario, both.

## Etiquette

I receive approximately 250 emails and text messages each and every day (and, sadly, yes, that does include Sunday!). I’d therefore be grateful if you would include a descriptive subject line so that I can prioritise your email accordingly.

I would also be grateful if you would please avoid trying to sell me anything. I am a young and healthy man which means that I thankfully have absolutely no use for the many strange concotions in my Spam folder that offer to make it easier for me to satisfy those to whom I’m attracted.
