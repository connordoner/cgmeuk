      <p>Welcome to ConnorGurney.me.uk! It is, as you might guess from the name, the online home of your host, Connor Gurney.</p>

      <p>I’m the co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.gurste.com">Gurste</a> where we build software that helps organisations to share information before, during and after emergencies. The idea came about following my volunteering in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire when I managed technical matters for the <a href="https://grenfellsupport.wordpress.com">first website for those affected</a>.</p>

      <p>I also work for a global telecommunications company and support their residential customers with fixed-line services. Suffice to say that I love the people who I work with and for, hate sending unnecessary engineers when I can fix issues remotely, and am impartial on the best provider (well, I would be without my staff discount!).</p>

      <p>Whilst I seem to have less free time than ever nowadays, I spend what free time I do have trying to keep BlackBerry® smartphones (remember those?!) working, cycling along the UK’s coastline or cooking as authentic a butter chicken as I know how to.</p>

      <p>I can be contacted by following the instructions on my <a href="/me/contact.html">contact page</a>. I receive several hundred emails and text messages each and every a day so I’d be grateful if you would please follow the ettiquette described on that page.</p>
