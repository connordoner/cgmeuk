# About my website

As you’ll no doubt guess by the fact that you’re on ConnorGurney.me.uk, this is the online home of me, Connor Gurney (there’s more about me on my [homepage](../)).

I see this website as an authoritative source of information on who I am and what I’m working on, both personally and professionally. I much prefer it over entrusting my life’s work on the transient platforms that we’ve become acustomed to with the rise of what I now believe to be un-social media.

Technology-wise, it’s very simple: hand-written HTML, just as Tim Berners-Lee intended (I presume, anyway, as I haven’t asked him) which is hosted in an [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket with [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) sitting in front of it. The design is also deliberately simple to allow you to make your own stylistic decisions using your browser.

In line with my beliefs that privacy ought to be a human right, I don’t collect any personally-identifiable information, and nor do I use cookies or similar mechanisms to store data on your device. If that changes, I’ll update this page accordingly.

You’re welcome (and, indeed, encouraged) to [contact me](../me/contact.html) with feedback on my website.
