      <p>Welcome to ConnorGurney.me.uk! It is, as you might guess from the name,
         the online home of your host, Connor Gurney.</p>

      <p>I’m the co-founder and CEO of
         <a href="https://www.gurste.com">Gurste</a> where we build software
         that helps organisations to share information before, during and after
         emergencies. The idea came about following my volunteering in the
         aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire when I managed technical matters
         for the first website for survivors.</p>

      <p>Whilst I seem to have less free time than ever nowadays, I spend
         what free time I do have trying to keep BlackBerry® smartphones
         (remember those?!) working, cycling along the UK’s coastline or
         cooking as authentic a butter chicken as I know how to.</p>

      <p>I can be contacted by sending email to
         <a href="mailto:me@connorgurney.me.uk">me@connorgurney.me.uk</a>. I
         receive several hundred emails a day so I’d be grateful if you would
         please include a descriptive subject line to help me to prioritise your
         email accordingly.</p>
